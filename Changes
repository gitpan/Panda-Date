           - Better support for perl-32bit-int (now supported dates range is [-2**53, 2**53] instead of [-2**31, 2**31-1])
           - removed 'posix/*' timezones as useless (they are copies of /*)

2.1      02.02.2014
           - change compiler g++ -> c++
2.0      31.01.2014
           - Panda::Date is now built on top of libpanda-time - complete set of POSIX time functions written from scratch.
             It now works correctly with all ranges of dates in all timezones and perfomance has been greatly increased.
           - Panda::Date objects are now capable of working in different timezones with no perfomance penalty.
           - Panda::Date is no longer following POSIX::tzset() timezone. It has it's own tzset() function in Panda::Time.
           - Panda::Date comes with its own timezone DB (not used by default).
           - set_from in all classes has been renamed to 'set'
           - now(), today(), today_epoch(), string_format(), range_check() are now functions only (not a class/object methods).
           - methods 'add', 'subtract', etc renamed to 'add_new', 'subtract_new', etc
           - methods 'add_me', 'subtract_me', etc renamed to 'add', 'subtract', etc
           - month_border_adjust is no longer supported
           - added includes() method to P::D::Int class.
           - Better Storable hooks implementation (less space, saving timezone info).
           - '_year' and '_month' keys in hashes to constructor or clone functions are no longer supported.
